## WhatsAppStatusDownloader
This repository contains code for an app that downloads WhatsApp Status.

## How? 
Basically, the app copies viewed statuses from `../WhatsApp/Media/.Statuses` to another directory where they are 'saved'.

## Does it matter?
I don't know, but I sure learnt alot about I/O (in Java).
